# Trinkets
Imagine you were given a coding assignment.  
That assignment might have had educational value.  
It might not have.  
It might have taken valuable time out of your day.  
It might have taken 5 minutes.  
Writing it could have even been easy.  
Writing it could have been very, *very* annoying.  
But, for some reason, it scratches a little brain itch you had, and after finishing it, you feel satisfied.

Now imagine that assignment was created by none other than yourself.

Welcome to my collection of trinkets.
